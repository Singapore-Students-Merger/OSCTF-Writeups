By searching 'Greek Statue with a hammer' in the address bar, I received the following results that looks similar to the one in the picture.

I then image searched a small part of the cropped image given in the challenge and I found an instagram post which contained the image: https://www.instagram.com/p/CiRLGoBP-95/
I have gathered that the statue is called self made man and it is situated in Ho Chi Minh City.
