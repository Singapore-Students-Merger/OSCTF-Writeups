In the image, we are given a picture of a sign that shows an orange sign which points to the dormitory, as well as some blue elements of the sign in the picture.
Given no other information, we decided to google: 'Which vietnam university has orange and blue?'
FPT university is the top result. 'FPT University Ranking & Overview 2024' and it has the signature colours of orange, blue and green.
After trying a few of the campuses, we found the flag to be OSCTF{fptu_danang}
